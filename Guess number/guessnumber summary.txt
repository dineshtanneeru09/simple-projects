This Python script is a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and a specified upper bound (a). The script uses the random.randint() function to generate random numbers, then enters a loop in which users are asked to guess repeatedly. After each guess, the program responds: if the guess is too low, it prints "Sorry, guess again. Too low." If the figure is too high, it prints "Sorry, guess again. Too high." The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number, at which point the program greets them with a message indicating the correct number. The game uses a while loop to ensure that the user keeps guessing until it is correct. One correction needed was correcting a typo in response messages ("two low" and "two high") to "too low" and "too high". The game is adjustable by changing the upper limit (a), allowing the possible numbers to change. This script is a fun way to learn how to handle loops, conditionals, and user input in Python.
