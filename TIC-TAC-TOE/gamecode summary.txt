A program written in Python constructs a game of Tic Tac Toe between 2 players, either human or computer. The class TicTacToe manages the board of 9 spaces, checks for a winner in rows, columns, and diagonals, and saves available moves. The play function dictates the flow of the game by changing turns between players (X and O), checking if there is a winner after every move, and concluding the game in a tie. The program allows different kinds of players, like Human player (prompt user's input), Random Computer Player (that takes random moves), and Smart Computer Player (that uses strategy logic, probably based on minimax algorithm). While the game is going, the board gets updated continuously, and the script declares the winner or announces a tie. By default, a smart computer (X) competes against a human player (O), with brief pauses between moves-and full reschedule of events done to add clarity and make it easy to read.
