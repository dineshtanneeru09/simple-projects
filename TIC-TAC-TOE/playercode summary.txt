In this code, three distinct players are created for the game Tic Tac Toe, which are HumanPlayer, RandomComputerPlayer, and SmartComputerPlayer. Each player implements a different strategy of making moves. The HumanPlayer interacts with the user where the player is prompted to choose a valid square. This move must be made available for him. RandomComputerPlayer just chooses a random square out of the remaining available squares so that one is unable to identify his strategy. Otherwise, SmartComputerPlayer uses Minimax, which can see forward in time and weigh the alternatives, forcing a possible best move in the situation. Such a technique simulates all possible moves on the opponent's reactions, maximizing the score for the smart player and the minimizing one for the rival. The proper resultant needs to be followed by every decision made in order to keep the moral standard of SmartComputerPlayer playing optimally at either winning or losing in every situation. By integrating these player types with the previously written game logic, one can have an entirely comprehensive Tic Tac Toe game, where people can compete against either computerized unpredictable opponents or highly strategic computers.
