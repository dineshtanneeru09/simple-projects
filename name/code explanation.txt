This Python script creates a horizontal password representation using the ASCII artwork using asterisks A-Z using asterisks (*) and spaces. This includes individual functions for each line, with star patterns defined for each line to look like the corresponding line. A helper function, print_row, takes column positions as arguments to specify where asterisks should be placed in a 5-column grid, filling the rest with space The script processes user input in the form of it dynamically converts it to uppercase, and uses Python's to execute the corresponding character function exec() method. If the input contains unsupported characters, an error message is displayed. In practice, each character of the password is printed directly, separated by blank characters to ensure readability. This script is modular and flexible, allowing users to create visually appealing word art giving the ability to extend the design for additional icons or custom patterns
